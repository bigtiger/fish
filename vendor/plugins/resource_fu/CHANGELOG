* EXPERIMENTAL, significant improvements to the way resource helper
* delegations are handled.  Rather handy for the situations where 
* you are using a :name_prefix, :singular or :controller when 
* generating your map.resources routes.  Oh, and it handles singletons
* now too.

* May 2nd, 2007
* EXPERIMENTAL: controllers use a new method, default_template_path to
* figure out the default_template_name, rather than using the current
* strategoy of calling controller_path.

* Changing how you delegate url helpers

* April 9th, 2007
* Added in the 2 remaining features for polymorphic resources, pretty much
* exactly as I've used them before - as in, they haven't been prettied up 
* or refactored in any way.  As such, they are subject to change and should
* not be relied upon.  
* This commit is mostly to solicit comments and get input on what the 
* DSL should look like for describing url helper delegation.
